# Smith-Chart-simulation
A simple smith chart simulation, that based on the input from the user, shows the step-by-step plotting of a Smith chart using ProcessingJS.

Originally coded on Khan Academy on December 2015 when I was learning to code ([Link](https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/smith-animated/6494501727764480)). I have left the code untouched, though there is a lot of scope for improvement. Feel free to open a PR.

### How to use?
Enter values required to plot a smith chart in the text fields and click on 'Plot smith chart'. \
Example:

I don't remember the significance of the parameters.
